abstract: "In cases where the response variable in proportional data is confined to a limited interval, a regression model based on the assumption of normality can yield inaccurate results due to issues such as asymmetry and heteroscedasticity. In such cases, the beta regression model can be considered as an alternative. This model reparametrizes the beta distribution in terms of mean and precision parameters, assuming that the response variable follows a beta distribution. This allows for easy consideration of heteroscedasticity in the data. In this paper, we therefore aim to analyze proportional data using the beta regression model in two empirical analyses. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between smoking rates and coffee consumption using data from the 6th National Health Survey, and examine the association between regional characteristics in the U.S. and cumulative mortality rates based on COVID-19 data. In each analysis, we apply the ordinary least squares regression model, the beta regression model, and the extended beta regression model to analyze the data and interpret the results with the selected optimal model. The results demonstrate the appropriateness of applying the beta regression model and its extended version in proportional data."
